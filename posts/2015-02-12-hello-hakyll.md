### Hello, Hakyll!!

"So why [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)?", you ponder deeply as your browser slowly loads this page on your gorgeous high-resolution IPS screen, "why not [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), or perhaps even *WordPress*?"

To be frank, dynamic programming languages like Ruby or JavaScript are not my favorite, and I figured that since I've never written anything practical in Haskell (other than a futile first-order logic engine if you consider that to be practical), I might just as well generate my website using Haskell.

But why did I chose a static site generator in the first place? One word: indolent. Yet, something like WordPress that requires little to no setup would bore me to death. So Hakyll it is.

Setting up this site was pretty fun. Indeed, it's rather cool watching all the monads and applicative functors at work. Perhaps I'll actually post things once in a blue moon. Who knows.
